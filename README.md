# ResQMe - Disaster Response App

ResQMe is a mobile web application designed to help people in distress during a disaster. The app sends keep-alive packets to our server, allowing us to collect user location information in real-time. If a user needs help or loses internet connectivity, the app sets their status as "need help." In the event of a disaster, we use the data collected by the app to locate and assist those in need.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: server-side scripting and application logic
- HTML and CSS: client-side user interface design
- Vanilla JavaScript: interactivity and dynamic functionality
- Bootstrap: responsive and mobile-friendly UI components
- MySQL: database to store user information and location data

## Usage

To use ResQMe, follow these steps:

1. Connect to our mobile website or install our PWA app on your device.
2. You will see a red button on the screen. Click it if you need help.
3. If you click the button or lose internet connectivity, your status will be updated to "need help," and our team will be notified of your location.
4. You can switch to the "Map" tab to view a map of everyone in need of help.

Note: ResQMe is an anonymous web-based application, and no login is required. Simply connect to the ResQMe website or PWA app to start using our app immediately.
